# email
I used the smtplib library in order to send emails using python. I am a former Biotech Scientist who recently resigned and am tranistioning into software engineering.

This repository contains two files: (1.) email.py and (2.) index.html. The first file implements python code to send the email. The second file is an html representation of the email message.
